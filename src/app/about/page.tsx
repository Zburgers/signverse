            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              SignVerse aims to break down communication barriers by making Indian Sign Language (ISL) 
              accessible to all. We believe that education should be inclusive and available to every 
              individual regardless of hearing ability.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Through innovative technology and 3D animation, we're creating tools that help educators, 
              students, and families communicate effectively using sign language in educational environments.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Indian Sign Language?</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              India has one of the largest deaf populations in the world, with approximately 18 million people 
              who are deaf or hard of hearing. Despite this, awareness and accessibility of Indian Sign Language 
              remains limited, especially in educational settings.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              By focusing on Indian Sign Language, we're addressing a significant need for accessible 
              communication tools specifically designed for the Indian context, supporting both educators 
              and learners in creating more inclusive educational environments.
